A main inspiration of this book derives from Zernike-based simulation of imaging through atmospheric turbulence, which comes from a series of papers by myself and collaborators <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11210" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">1</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11627" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06713" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">3</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09036.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">4</a>.</p> <p>I’ve also given two tutorials for imaging through turbulence, one of which was at the 2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern (CVPR) which you can watch on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_VY0KToV_s" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Youtube</a>. Alternatively, my final defense went through each version of the simulator step-by-step, so if you want you can get the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d5N2jf10Am_9yNy8z8x2UcPsyvRo5wh-/view?usp=sharing" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">slides</a> to have an abridged and more personal take on it.</p> <p>My main interests are computational imaging and image processing with specific emphasis on forward modeling. The concept of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11635" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">computational image formation</a> in particular is a major theme in my interests and direction.</p> </body></html>
