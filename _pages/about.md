I am a postdoc at Purdue University working with Professor [Stanley Chan](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChanGroup/stanleychan.html) and also receieved my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Purdue University.


I'm a co-author of the book [Computational Imaging through Atmospheric Turbulence](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/computational-imaging-through-atmospheric-turbulence-stanley-h-chan/1143986968) which focuses on presenting the basic concepts of optics and turbulence physics as they pertain to image reconstruction. A main inspiration of this book derives from Zernike-based simulation of imaging through atmospheric turbulence, which comes from a series of papers by myself and collaborators [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11210) [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11627) [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06713) [4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09036.pdf).


I've also given two tutorials for imaging through turbulence, one of which was at the 2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern (CVPR) which you can watch on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_VY0KToV_s). Alternatively, my final defense went through each version of the simulator step-by-step, so if you want you can get the [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d5N2jf10Am_9yNy8z8x2UcPsyvRo5wh-/view?usp=sharing) to have an abridged and more personal take on it.


My main interests are computational imaging and image processing with specific emphasis on forward modeling. The concept of [computational image formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11635) in particular is a major theme in my interests and direction.
