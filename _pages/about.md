I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University under Professor [Stanley Chan](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChanGroup/stanleychan.html). I work on optical forward modeling for inverse problems involving atmospheric turbulence and meta-surface imaging systems (soon).

I have given two tutorials for imaging through turbulence, one of which was at the 2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern (CVPR) which may be seen on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_VY0KToV_s). Prof. Chan and I were also invited to write a tutorial on the content of our CVPR tutorial which will be published with Now Publisher's [Foundations and Trends in Computer Vision](https://www.nowpublishers.com/CGV). If you're interested, feel free to check out their website or [go here] to access the tutorial (not yet posted).
